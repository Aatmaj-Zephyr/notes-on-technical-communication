### Practising is the key

1. Practise is the key.
2. Practise multiple times in front of friends (mock presentations). Rehearse many times. With friends. With advisor.
3. Practise with self using google slides presenter practise mode: Measure time taken
4. Practise using the same material (slides/whiteboard) as will be available in front of the final presentation
5. It is a good idea to speak with. a audience member (a friend) just before giving the talk. Warms you up.


### Speaking guildelines

1) Dont worry if you are nervous.
2) Speak loud and clear  - even with a mic, using a `low, private conversational voice’  does not work for presentations.
3) Imagine you are speaking without a mic in a small room (15-20 people), use that volume.
4) Face the audience, make eye contact, should look at different people at different times. Do not look at the same person (e.g. your guide) the whole time
5) Do not look at the laptop screen while presenting, alternate between looking at and pointing to the projector display screen  and  looking at the audience.
6) Stand at a position and at an angle that you can look  at and/or point to the projected display and look  at the audience
7) If screen is too large and not easy to point to, ensure you have a laser pointer
8) If stage is too large and laptop too far away, make sure you have a slide advancing remote



### Answering questions

1. Prepare FAQs and make slides (supplementary slides) for them
2. Practise, colect FAQs
3. Collect questions that can be asked from LLMs
4. More you sweat during peace,  less you bleed during war - go collect more probable questions that can be asked and add them to slides
5.Clarification Questions: I didnt follow your definition, what if ...? Should be answered immediately.
6. Argumentative/Evaluative Questions: What is your opinion of xyz method? Better to defer to the end. Politely say so
