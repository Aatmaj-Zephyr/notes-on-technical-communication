# Guildelines for making PPT

1. While making PPT - think from the 3rd person point of view. they dont know anything about your project. Make it easy for them to understand. (Empathy towards the reader)
2. Make 2 different sets of PPTs
   1. documentation PPT (optional)
   2. presentation PPT

### Documentation PPT

1. The role of this is to act as a detailed documentation of your work (For any other person or yourself.) and possibly supplementary slides.
2. Others should be able to recreate the entire work based on this
3. It should contain all low level details about the algorithm
4. Add lot of data, charts, numbers (pls dont dump data, make sure it is understandable.)
5. This will serve as your reference
6. Start making this PPT once you have got hold of something concerte
7. Add all failed attempts
8. Make it as excustive as possible
9. Reader should be able to 100% understand what is going on just by reading the PPT (doesnt mean you add sentences and paragraphs here - stick to bullets)

### Presentation PPT

1. This will be used for presenting the work
2. Short and sweet. No need to tell everything here.
3. If details are asked during presentation, refer that content from documentation PPT
4. Make PPT in such a way that even. a distracted person should be able to get idea of
   1. What problem are you solving
   2. Gist of what you have done
   3. Key takeaway
5. Make sure to make your PPT align with your goal. Goal of your presentation may be very different:
   1. Winning a prize for best presentation in an international conference
   2. Explaining others what you have done (handover to next person)
   3. Getting mentorship / feedback (Meeting with guides)
   4. Impressing others that you are very smart (Departmental symposiums)
   5. Impressing the work that you have done is worth sponsering (Startup pitch/ project competition)
6. Get idea of your audience before making the PPT
7. Ideally, talk should induce audience to read the research paper.

### Guidelines on  making presentation PPT

1. Slides are a visual aid to your presentation. They are not the presentation itself.
2. Add lot of images and icons into the PPT (without making it distracting)
3. Your speech and the words in it is what the audience should be tuned to
4. Audience should be able to simultaneously listen to you and process whatever is on screen.
5. Audience should never have to “read” whatever is on the slide. (When they read, they are not listening to you, these two cannot be done at the same time).
6. Thus slides are easily processable ‘visual aids’ - like figures, graphs, and few words which are just useful to focus attention (can be in callouts, textboxes, etc)
7. Add callouts to every mathematical equation. You may know what those equations mean, but the other person does not
8. Tip: Imagine you have to give the  presentation using  a whiteboard. What would you draw on the board?  How would you build the picture on the board? That is what goes into slides!!
9. Try writing formulae in words rather than symbols. It is very difficult for audience to absorb lot of symbols. If you must use symbols - repeat the symbol definition on every slide where they are used
10. Describe overall idea and structure: Try to convey intuition.
11. Describe algorithms at a high level: Describe pictorially if possible.
12. Consider top down style.
13. Draw before and after pictures. Latex has packages for writing algorithms Manages indentation, highlights keywords.
14. Omit unimportant details: I will only explain the first step of this proof, the other steps are routine and are described in the report I will only describe the second step of the algorithm .
15. Simplify theorems/proofs: I will prove a simpler version in the talk; the paper contains a more general version, whose proof is much more complicated. I will describe an O(NlogN) algorithm in the talk; but it is possible to improve to O(N) using standard techniques- this is described in the paper.
16. Use analogies and metaphors to explain complex concepts in a more relatable way.

### Introducing the problem

1. Unlike research. paper, there is no need to be dry and boaring
   1. Begin with a story
   2. Light hearted opening
   3. Establish real-world connection/motivation for the topic of your talk.
   4. Personal Anecdote
   5. Philosophical remark
   6. Example of Problem (pictorial if possible)
   7. Puzzle
2. Description of input and output, what you are doing is a must


### Mode of PPT

1. Various softwares available
   1. Google slides
   2. Latex
2. Make sure to save your slides in PDF and PPTx format. (Carry backup pendrive)
3.
