1) Use Zotero. This will solve half of your problems
2) Use plugins and my custom scripts on zotero.
3) Use templatized notes for litrature survey
4) Spend enough time on designing the template. If it needs to be updated the sooner you update it the better.
5) Use different chrome profiles (preferable different profiles for each different topic) This makes saving history and visited links easier
6) The more detailed notes you take for every research paper the better. Once you move on, it is very difficult to go back and re-read all those papers again because you didnt note down a particular thing.
7) Write notes longer and more details always. It can be reduced later, but not increased
8) These notes can be then used by RAG and LLMs for future works
9) More detailed and the more concentrated, the better. Write short bullet points but cover all points
10) Cover every aspect of the methodology - dont ignore any parameter (eg computing time, CPU brand) even if you feel it is not important today, you might realize it's importance years later. Many papers may not have this listed
11) If you enounter a new parameter after 10 references, add it into your template and go backand change the tamplarte for all the 10 refernces. The earlier you update the templates, the better it will be.
12) If you want to request papers (or ppt or any supplementry material) from closed source documents, then do it early on as the authors may take their own sweet time.
13) Remember that your notes will be used by AI, and also by JS scropt for parsing and info management. Hence maintain uniformity accross the notes.
14) Take high level mindmaps of the notes which comapare papers and express various schools of thought after reading some papers. Use zotero linked nots features for that (betternotes plugin)
15) Use annotations andcoor coding,  use symbol script written by me
16) Backup zotero with
    1) Zip backup of folder
    2) Google drive backup of folders
    3) Web library backup
       1) Note that due to storage limits, it is a good idea to turn off the file sync feature for a. particular web shared library and enable file sync only for a few papers (ie local library)
17) Include relevant important flowcharts and diagrams from the PDF so that glancing is easy. Use the add to pdf feature in better notes.
18) Note that a lot of zotero workflow eg notes does not support collaborative work or even accross different devices. Hence it is good idea to take backup of the entire zotero folder itself by zipping it. Take regular backups. Take a backup after every major change made in the zotero settings.
19) Add explanations of mathematical expressions by handwritten and. put the images into seperate note.
