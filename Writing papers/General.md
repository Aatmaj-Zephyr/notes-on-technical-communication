# A few general tips
### Why should we care to write good papers?
* Well-written papers are read, remembered, cited. Poorly written papers are not 🙃


### Writing Quality & Impact

* For perfection in writing: read and revise, again and again. Ask friends to read.
* Look for and emphasize beauty
* Editors and reviewers are all busy scientists – make things easy to save their time. Else they wont save yours!
* Fortunately or unfortunately - the paper decides how good your research is, and eventually how good you are. So you have only got a surface of 4-12 pages (excluding citations) to impress the reviewer.

### Perceived Quality of Research

* Quality of paper = quality of Research x quality of writing

* perceived quality of Research =
  problem statement understanding of reader x perceived efforts taken x rigour of solution x improvement over past (results -> absolute and relative)

* perceived efforts taken =
  no of methods compared against (not studied) x no of empirical testing (or other practical validation apart from mathematical) performed x Amount of analysis done (covering all senerios etc)

* rigour of solution =
  mathematical formulation x algorithm novelty x "aha" & "wow" moments

### Structure, Flow & Organization

* Gradual revealing like a newspaper - Begin each block with an overview:
  Report overview: first chapter
  Chapter overview: first section
  Section overview: first paragraph
  Paragraph overview: first sentence

* Tip -> Fractally apply the 3 rules:
  Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you have told them

* Conclude properly: End each block with a summary.
  Last chapter: Summary and Conclusions
  Last section of each chapter: What did the chapter accomplish? What is important for the rest of the chapters (hook).

* Exceptions to rule:
  Overview/summary not necessary if block is too small, or is exceedingly well written. “self-documenting code”

* One chapter should contain only one big idea.

* One section should contain only one small idea.

* Cohesion in between sections

* Minimize forward referencing

### Emphasis & Presentation

* Pictures: worth thousands of words

* Examples: most necessary. This is where you can add value. Constructing good examples takes creativity.

* Explain theorems with examples in addition to formal proof.

* Theorem / Lemmas / Definitions:
  Reserve for important ideas. Less important ideas can go in paragraphs.

* To emphasize an idea:

  * Give it its entire chapter (with suitable title)
  * Give it its entire section (with suitable title)
  * Give it its independent paragraph / several paragraphs
  * Define notation to express it

### Reader Behavior & Practical Rules

* The SSC rule -> read only first and last parts of answer, rest is ignored 🙃

---

### Language & Grammar

* Avoid abbreviations: “it’s”, “weren’t”, “hasn’t”

* Common grammatical errors:

  * Mixing tenses
  * Mixing active and passive voice
  * Use LLMs to check/ correct

---

### Extended abstract & Cover Letter

* **Extended abstract**: If you're not sure if an article is appropriate for a particular journal, you don't have to submit it and wait 6-12 months for an answer. Write up a 1-2 page summary of your article (called an "extended abstract"), and send it to the editor asking if it's appropriate. They'll probably answer within a week or two.

* Cover letter -> Your chance to speak to the editor directly:

  * Submitted along with your manuscript
  * Mention what would make your manuscript special to the journal
  * Note special requirements (reviewers, conflicts of interest)

---

### Value Addition by You


* If some idea is your own, mention explicitly.
* If you constructed an example, mention that.
* If you found a shorter proof, mention that.

---

### Novelty, Claims & Ethics

* Special care should be taken for the claim of novelty and the contributions.
* You should be able to backup to your claim.
* This claim will go on permanent record for global scrutiny.
* If the claim is not true, it is plagarism and/or ignorance.
