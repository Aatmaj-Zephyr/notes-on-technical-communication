### Discussion: So what?
What are the implications of your research. What do the results state?
- Emphasize major points (and advantages) first
- Extract principles, relationships, generalisations.
- Interpret the results: Give cause analysis
- Present analysis, model or theory. 
- Discuss any unexpected results
- Breifly describe the limitations
- Compare results with other studies
- Show relationship between the results and analysis, model or theory.
- Explain the graphs meaning here. Eg graph goes up with increasing no of samples at logarithmic rate, which means that ...... ....lesser samples needed than method 2 ..  Also mention what it means
- In the end, gather it all together what do all the results collectively mean together
