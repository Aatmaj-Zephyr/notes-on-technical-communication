# Conclusion
- Start with a brief statement of the major findings and implications
- Remember that many people read conclusion first before going to the main content.
- You need to highlight why to read the paper by its summary
- Emphasize novelty and originality
- Summarization of the work
- Be vague & high level while explaining the results part and cross reference results section for more precise results.
- Add few numbers. Eg 35% increase in some scenerios as discussed in section 6.2) Dont explain which scenerios, let them go to section 6.2
- Leave the reader to decide on importance and significance of the paper (Dont rate yourself. Our research is  the first highly accurate pioneering .... no .)
- Dont do open salesman here. Do hidden sales. (Shameless marketting goes into abstract and intro parts)
- Gist of what all is done
	- Is empirical testing done? how rigourous? In which section?
	- Is mathematics proven? In which section?
- No repeatition from introduction, but still similar in nature
- What problem have you solving? What is the societal impact? (Eg this solution saves the downtime by 10%)

###  More tips
- "This paper questions the basic assumptions of fracture mechanics…" (this from a real manuscript) fills the reader with mistrust; after all, fracture mechanics works.
- This very important result…., This significant finding…. are better replaced by the simpler This result… and This finding….
