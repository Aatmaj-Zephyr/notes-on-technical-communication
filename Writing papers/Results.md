# Results
- Add hard data, charts, graphs, dont add what they mean. Eg only mention that time complexity is O(n^2) Dont mention it is a huge increase over present O(n^3) methods. (this goes in discussion)
- Only explain what graphs represent. Eg graph of Accuracy in method 1 & Accuracy in method 2 [hogh 2022]  (red line) vs no of samples for XYZ data set [mnist, 1993] when using parameters a,b,c (green dashed ) d,b,c (yellow dotted) plotted in color lines etc. It is in log scale, it goes up asymptotically till 1
- Don’t mix Results with Discussion. Report your results simply, without opinion or interpretation at this stage. 
- Give error-bars or confidence-limits for numerical or graphical data (This seperates good work from the bad)
- Statistics should be meaningful; avoid confidence-eroding statements such as “33.3% of the samples failed: 33.3% survived; the third sample was unfortunately misplaced.”
- Dont throw data at the audience (Data != information) It should have some meaning that the audience can grasp immediately. Then you can explain the meaning in results and what it implicitly means in the discussion
