# Writing style
- Avoid unnecessary words in a sentence to make it concentrated and not diluted but at the same time clear
- Write compactly
- Give good examples
- Reader should be able to understand something even if he / She skims through the document
- No need to read from page 1 to last page to understand the whole paper


### Grammer tips

1) Convert nouns to verbs  
  - His verticality changed to horizontality → He fell down  
  - This paragraph provides a conclusion of the description → This paragraph concludes the description  
  - … recursively performs composition of edges → … recursively composes edges  

2) Avoid multiple adjectives  
  - multiple double arrow edges → multiple edges with double arrows  

### Make sentences simpler
Same idea can be expressed by several sentences.

1. Cast iron is changed into steel when treated in a Bessemer converter.  

2. When treated in a Bessemer converter, cast iron is changed to steel.  

3. Cast iron, when treated in a Bessemer converter, is changed into steel.  

Which sentence to use depends upon the context and purpose.

- **Purpose** = Essay on cast iron.  
- **Context** = Previous sentence talks about Bessemer converters.  
- **Purpose** = Create suspense … usually not needed in technical writing.
