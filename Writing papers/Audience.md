# Type of audience 

- If you can satisfy a bigger population without being more verbose, Great! 
- But otherwise person reading your paper might have read at least 50 papers in the same area before coming across your paper
- Reader persona:
	- Type1: Novice (who are just starting out or experts in another domains)
	- Type2:  Experts in general feild (Eg satelltite image processing, computer vision)
	- Type3: Experts in your feild (Eg Medical image processing) (likely reviewers for a general conference on image processsing)
	- Type4: Experts in your feild who have read 50 papers on same topic. eg tomography of xxx (likely reviewers for a special conference on medical image processing)
- Need to take care of all 
- When you are doing or not doing something, then you should state reason. Eg If you didnt put Accuracy as a matrix but put FPR as matrix then you need to state the reason behind it. the reason would be obvious to you and type 4 readers but may not be apparent to type2 people who have been using 'accuracy' in there other research.
- The general rule that seems to be gaining currency is that 80% of your talk/report should be accessible to other colleagues of yours in the same field (but without any specific expertise in your topic).  The rest of it may be intended for a more expert audience . 
- For every sentence, you should be able to state who your audience is.

### Reader persona analysis

| Role     | Problem                         | Solution                        | View / Focus                            | Technical                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Novice   | What is it?                     | Don’t care much                 | High-level view                         | No                                        |
| Expert   | How is it big? w.r.t my problem | How is it big? w.r.t my problem | Focus on background                     | Halfway — not skim                        |
| Reviewer | What is it exactly?             | What aligns to solution?        | Good results (abstract terms)           | Understands ~80% of the time              |
| Surveyor | Knows                           | What’s better over others       | Comparison over others (relative terms) | Skim through (related work, similar ones) |

### Grass is always green on the other side

- Remember that the papers mostly are peer reviewed
- Your 'peers' may not know your identity, but they know your research.
- These 'peers' are not free from bias and prejudice towards a certain research aspect
- They may always compare your work against their own
- they may always feel your work is inferior when compared to theirs
