	- Generic, broad-based, and related the major concept of the paper
	- Keywords help in reviewer identification & also visibility of your paper
- Abstract summarizes your contributions in simple words.

- A clear and accurate recapitulation of the paper.  
- Usually written as one or two paragraphs.  
- Words should be simple, jargon avoided, and abbreviations omitted.

- Abstract is your best hook
- Not too long, not too short
- An abstract is neither a summary nor an outline of the paper.
  - A summary is a short, matter-of-fact description.
  - A summary tells us what to expect (or what to remember).
  - A conclusion tells us the moral of the story.
  - An abstract tells us why we should read what is to come.
- A checklist for abstract making:
	- [ ] Motivation  
	- [ ]  Problem statement  
	- [ ] Approach  
	- [ ] Results  
	- [ ] Conclusions  

- Must contain a statement that catches attention.
