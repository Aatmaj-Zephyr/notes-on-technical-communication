# Theorems
It is good to start from basics, but only after giving the top level 'grand' result

Top down 
1) grand result
2) Theorems
3) sub theorems

Bottom up
1) Sub theorems
2) theorems
3) Grand Result

A good approach
1) grand result gist
2) Sub theorems
3) theorems
4) Grand Result

If some quantity is important in your work, it probably deserves to be defined explicitly (say using latex \definition).  It probably also deserves to get a good symbol.  The converse is also true -- if you are giving names and defining symbols for unimportant quantities, you are probably doing something wrong!

Placement of definitions: close to the point of use.  DO NOT PUT ALL DEFINITIONS AT THE TOP.  This is similar to variable declarations in programs.  Truly important definitions (global scope) should be at the top -- and the less important, local ones close to the point of use. HOWEVER: it should somehow be clear where I should look up a definition if I need it somewhere in the middle of your report -- please dont assume that I will always read your report from the beginning and will remember everything.

Try to add proof by example for heavy mathematical proofs. (Not as a substitite) This way no one needs to read the heavy parts until their 3rd pass (when they are really hooked)
