# Diagrams

- Ensure that all diagrams are 
	- High Quality PNG Export
	- Store one infinitely scalable per images (SVG or TIkZ) format for the image (Exception: Drawio as you save the source)
	- support greyscale printing, especially graph lines
     - If at a later stage you are required to submit to journal that doesnt support color this becomes real headache.
     - Use different line styles (dots, dashes etc) + color
     - If reviewer decides to print your paper then reviewer should be able to read all diagrams 
	- Large font size relative to digram
	- As compact as possible (Least white space)
	- You have source code of the image (drawio, excel, code etc)
- Best thing to do is to use drawio on VS code and save it as an editable image. Change the property to set zoom to 200%. 
- Add as many graphical abstracts and diagrams as possible
- Diagrams are a GREAT way of explaining concepts in least time when people are skimming through paper
- They can form the best (and perhaps the only) hook for Type 4 people 
- Saves time of reviewer in first pass.
- Anyone scanning your paper will look at the figures and their captions, even if they do not read the text.
