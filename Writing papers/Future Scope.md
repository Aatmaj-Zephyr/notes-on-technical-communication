### Future scope
- If you write "These ideas could **easily** be extended to the non-linear case" … makes the reader wonder why you didn’t do it.
- Remove the word easily. Nothing is easy. Either it is possible or not possible
- And never, ever, apologise. "Unfortunately, there was insufficient time to complete the last set of tests" suggests bad planning, laziness, incompetence.
